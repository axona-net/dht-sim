// =====================================================================
// AxonaPeer — per-node DHT contract implementation for NH-1.
//
// ── Migration status (Phase 1 of NH1-PerNode-Refactor-Plan-v0.71.md) ──
//
// Phase 1 — Skeleton + co-existence.
//
// This class exists to implement the per-node DHT contract at
// `src/contracts/DHT.js` against the existing multi-node
// `AxonaEngine` (the simulator's NH-1 engine).  In Phase 1 every
// method is a thin delegation to the engine, with the per-node
// `NeuronNode` reference passed through where the engine expects it.
//
// The intent is to validate the per-node API shape (matches the
// contract, can be constructed cleanly, can be observed via getMetrics
// and onEvent) before moving any actual protocol logic out of the
// engine.  Subsequent phases (2 → 3) progressively move read-only and
// then write operations into this class; Phase 4 then renames today's
// engine to `NHOneEngine` and finalises the split.
//
// During Phase 1 the simulator's behaviour is unchanged: the engine
// still owns all the routing logic; AxonaPeer is just an alternative
// API surface that production peers can use to exercise NH-1 through
// the contract.
//
// ── What this class IS ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//   - The DHT contract (src/contracts/DHT.js) implementation for one peer
//   - One instance per running node (in both sim and production)
//   - Owns: a reference to its NeuronNode (per-node state), a reference
//     to the engine (during Phase 1; later phases move logic here), a
//     reference to its transport, and a set of per-peer event listeners.
//
// ── What this class IS NOT ───────────────────────────────────────────
//   - A multi-node manager (that's the engine's job)
//   - A wrapper that hides the engine's existence from the simulator
//     (Phase 1 keeps the engine reachable so the simulator's tests and
//     Engine-cycle code continue to work)

   * own subset), `current_count`/`seq`/`bytes` are maxed (they converge across the
   * cohort via anti-entropy; max tolerates a lagging member).
   *
   * TIMING: on a COLD topic (no recent watcher) the first snapshot arrives ~2-20s
   * after demand turns on — beyond the default 1500ms window — so the first call
   * returns stale:true unless a snapshot from a prior watcher is still in the 48h

  // ─── Diagnostics + log/error/upgrade event surfaces (A6) ──────────
  //
  // Apps consume these for observability:
  //
  //   peer.health()         → snapshot of synaptome / axon / connections
  //                            / replay-cache / wireVersion / uptime
  //   peer.onLog(level, h)  → 'debug' | 'info' | 'warn' | 'error'
  //   peer.onError(h)       → fires on background AxonaError emissions
  //   peer.onUpgradeRequired(h) → fires on version-handshake mismatch
  //
  // The underlying log/error/upgrade events come from the transport
  // layer (today via the `log` callback we passed to the factory).
  // The peer offers a typed event surface on top so apps don't need
  // to wire transport-specific callbacks themselves.

  /**
   * Did the lookahead fan-out earn its traffic?
   *
   * Kernel 4.80.0 measured the RECEIVE side: `lookahead_probe` is 83% of all
   * inbound mesh frames (three windows: 80.4%, 83.1%, 83.5%), a steady ~9.9
   * probes/sec from every peer, against 0.4 routed messages/sec. Per-peer rate
   * is constant as the mesh grows, so a node's probe load is O(N) and the
   * network's is O(N-squared) — roughly 54,000 probe messages/sec across a
   * 75-node mesh.
   *
   * That says what the traffic COSTS. It cannot say what it BUYS, because a
   * receiver cannot see whether the sender's fan-out changed the sender's
   * routing decision. This counts that, at the only site that emits probes:
   *
   *   probesEmitted / probingCalls   how wide each fan-out actually is
   *   probesCloserThanMe             replies naming a node closer than me —
   *                                  the only replies that can change anything
   *   answeredByProbe                calls where the fan-out supplied the answer
   *   answeredByIncoming             calls answered by incomingSynapses, which
   *                                  costs NO network — the probes bought nothing
   *   answeredNull                   calls that found nobody closer at all
   *
   * `usefulProbeRate` is answeredByProbe / probingCalls. If it is near zero at
   * steady state on a warm mesh, the fan-out is paying O(N-squared) for an
   * answer it rarely provides — and the design question becomes how to keep the
   * sparse-mesh escape without paying for it continuously. If it is high, the
   * traffic is load-bearing and the fix has to be cheaper probing, not less.
   *
   * Counts only: no ids, no targets, no payloads.
