// =====================================================================
// AxonaManager.js — Axona pub/sub: the routing-only axonic tree.
//
// Design: axona-docs/architecture/Pubsub-Axon-Tree-v0.1.md
//
// CLEAN BREAK (kernel v3.15.0). Routing-only pub/sub. The one rule:
//
//     Axona pub/sub uses ONLY DHT message routing. There are no direct
//     connections. Every interaction is a routed message delivered, hop by
//     hop, to the single live node closest to a 264-bit target.
//
// A message published to a topic is ROUTED toward the topic id; the closest
// live node is the (emergent, never-elected) ROOT. The root assigns a single
// monotonic timestamp — the serialization point that gives the topic a total
// order — caches it, and fans it out to its subscribers by routing a deliver
// to each. Subscribers renew toward the topic id every minute; that renewal
// is at once the keepalive, the failure detector, the self-heal, and (with a
// `since` hint) the gap-recovery. A subscriber carries an ordered `via`
// waypoint list (its `upstream`) so it is pinned to its relay yet always falls
// back to the topic id if that waypoint is gone.
//
// PHASE 2 — THE TREE. When a relay exceeds MAX_DIRECT subscribers it delegates:
// it promotes one of its subscribers to a child relay and hands it a batch of
// the others. A child relay subscribes UP toward the topic id (pinned by its
// parent via), caches the feed, and re-fans each message DOWN to its own
// subscribers exactly once. Delegated subscribers receive their deliveries
// from the child, so they repin to it and renew toward it — the tree is stable
// — but a dead waypoint always falls through to the topic id and re-seats, so
// the tree is self-healing and re-roots if the root itself dies.
//
// (Implementation choice: a relay promotes one of its own SUBSCRIBERS — a
// known-alive participant it can already route to — as the child. The design's
// "one of its connections" is satisfied without the manager needing a
// synaptome/neighbour list; routing reaches the chosen node regardless.)
//
// PHASE 3 — DURABILITY. A SUBSCRIBE advertises the sender's cache high-water; a
// relay/root that is BEHIND a reattaching subscriber pulls its stamped history
// UP (PULLUP → REPLAYUP) and adopts it without re-stamping, advancing lastTs so
// new publishes continue monotonically above it. This carries the topic's recent
// history across abrupt root death (a fresh empty root recovers it from any
// surviving cache-bearing relay) and across graceful migration.
//
// The side functions (kill/unpub/touch/pull/metrics/host) remain thin —
// markers TODO(Phase 4). GONE for good: sendDirect, findKClosest, K-closest
// fan-out, root sets, the old recruit/adopt/promote/dissolve + msgsync/kill-sync.

  //       bigint from production adapters and hex from doubles, and a padding
  //       or type mismatch must never masquerade as "different node".

  //       presume a DELIVER will arrive to re-home us (seq 149 — a
  //       non-subscribing root may never receive one); if a genuinely closer
  //       live root exists, its own beacons demote us at receipt, which is the
  //       standing evidence-of-life path. Pinning toward a root that never
  //       touched the message would re-create the corpse-pin this replaces.
  //   failed → invalidate ONLY the matching beacon record (same root, same
  //       `at` stamp — a late verdict must not erase a newer beacon). No
  //       demote, no pin. The invalidation lands sub-second, inside the
  //       publisher's early-resend pump window, so the SAME message's retries
  //       arrive at a node that will now root and ingest properly. "First
  //       lost, second saved" is the floor, not the expectation.
  //   unsupported / violation → NO state transition (violation logs loudly).

  // the true root, so a fresh subscriber's SUB is never seated and no history is
  // replayed. Reads have no PENDING_PUB equivalent, so nothing re-sends them.
  // Two measured recoveries, restored here as one funnel:
  //
  //  (a) WARM-HINT FIRST. _rootHint_ background-warms the true-root hint (beacon
  //      or iterative K-closest). When it has a hint, route the SUB through it —
  //      synchronously. refreshTick renews unpinned subs every renewFastMs

  //      so each fast renewal re-routes toward the freshly-resolved root — that
  //      IS the bounded-read-retry half, no separate retry loop needed.
  //
  //  (b) COLD FIRST ATTEMPT, no warm hint yet. Emit the first SUB GREEDY *now*
  //      (never delayed), THEN run a BOUNDED iterative NETWORK lookup (escapes the
  //      cold synaptome's local minima — the origin-independent oracle), raced
  //      against SUB_LOOKUP_MS, and STEER a follow-up SUB toward the resolved root
  //      if it names a different reachable node. The first SUB is NEVER blocked on
  //      the lookup: rootElection.js:208 — a SUB that waits on an unbounded lookup
  //      and misses the join window is never sent → 0% delivery (observed live).
  //      Emitting greedy first satisfies that invariant unconditionally (the SUB is
  //      always on the wire immediately); the bounded steer only ADDS reach. An
  //      earlier draft awaited the lookup BEFORE the first emit — bounded, but it
  //      still deferred every cold subscribe (including a node subscribing to a
  //      topic it itself roots) by up to SUB_LOOKUP_MS, a real latency regression.

  //
  // WHY it fires here and not at root:fanout alone. A single root:fanout is ONE
  // branch transmission; the eligible recipient set of a publish is spread across
  // the whole delivery tree. So this stamps at EVERY fanning node (root and each
  // intermediate relay — _fanout is the one choke point they all pass through).
  // The union of these per-node ledgers reconstructs the tree, joined ACROSS nodes
  // by msgId (the stable cross-tree identity — node-local seq is NOT a join key).
  //
  // TREE POSITION AND DELIVERY OBLIGATION ARE SEPARATE FACTS (Aster 722f8464). A
  // node can be BOTH an intermediate forwarder AND a local app subscriber, so graph
  // leafhood — "a sub that is never a node" — does NOT equal the app-subscriber
  // denominator; it would silently drop subscribed forwarders. Two explicit fields:
  // per recipient edge, `child`=1 marks a relay-forwarding edge (0 = a terminal
  // leaf-subscriber edge); per node, `localDelivery`=1 marks that THIS node's own
  // app owes delivery. Reconciliation derives expected app recipients as
  // {child=0 recipient edges} ∪ {localDelivery=1 nodes}, deduped by nodeId — never
  // from leafhood. `parent` (this node's upstream) + node/seq/epoch separate seat
  // reattachments for the same topic.

  // WHAT it records: per message x LOCAL subscriber, the lease state the fanning
  // node BELIEVED at send time — full-hex id (joins to deliver:app / sub:recv),
  // {since,lastRenewed}, lease age, whether the recipient is a child-relay edge, and
  // whether it is the sender we skip. Per node: localDelivery obligation, upstream
  // parent, and epoch/seq so a publish is pinned to the topology incarnation.
  //
  // WHAT it deliberately does NOT do: pre-filter exclusions. Expired-lease / self /
  // child-relay / sender-dedup are recorded as RAW state (+ dropMs threshold), so
  // the reconciliation analyzer applies the DECLARED exclusion policy transparently
  // instead of the kernel silently dropping recipients from the denominator. Its
  // divergence from the harness's ground-truth subscribe log is the signal that
  // localizes loss to BEFORE fanout (eligible but absent here) vs AFTER (present
  // here, no deliver:app). Same LAT_TRACE gate; byte-identical when off; bounded by
  // maxDirect recips per node.
