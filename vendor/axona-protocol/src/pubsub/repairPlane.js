    // I first wrote here that the false credit also SUPPRESSED THE RETRY, since
    // `full` re-arms on `want.some(hex => !role.replicas.has(hex))` above. The
    // fence does not show that: with the pre-fix code and every push throwing,
    // pushes still continued on later ticks (fence_replica_ledger 2a passes both
    // ways), because the signature check and the ROOT_REPLICATE_FULL_MS backstop
    // re-arm independently. Whether the FULL-vs-keepalive distinction is starved
    // is untested and remains a hypothesis, not a finding. What is demonstrated
    // is narrower and sufficient: the ledger claimed replicas that do not exist.
    //
    // NOTE ON THE NAME: `replicas` still overclaims. A non-throwing _syncPush
    // proves LOCAL DISPATCH, not remote possession — Aster's three-way split of
    // selection / dispatch / receipt. Renaming it (and deciding what discharges
    // the ROOT obligation) is the open C4 decision; this change deliberately
    // does not pre-empt it, and lastFullAt below is untouched for that reason.
    // The ledger records the EVIDENCE, per Aster's selection / dispatch / receipt
    // split. routeMessage reports failure by RESOLVING {consumed:false,...} rather
    // than throwing, so the verdict comes from the resolved value:
    //   consumed:true    → role.replicas   via:'consumed'     — verified dispatch
    //   consumed:false   → role.attempted  via:'failed'       — explicit failure
    //   rejection        → role.attempted  via:'failed'       — explicit failure
    //   declared none    → role.attempted  via:'unsupported'  — honest, no evidence
    //   claimed, void    → role.attempted  via:'violation'    — contract breach, LOUD
    //
    // ONLY 'consumed' CREDITS. An earlier version of this comment — and of the
    // code — recorded a void return as 'unreported' and credited it as a replica,
    // which let test doubles set a production durability semantic. Both reviewers
    // rejected the inference itself: capability is DECLARED, never guessed
    // (v4.58.0). See dispatch.js.

    // Phase C — durability fallback (v4.24.1, #333). A departing node must
    // NEVER send REPLICATE: 4.24.0 sprayed every unacked topic's cache to the
    // K-closest cohort here, and each recipient became a BACKUP of a root that
    // was — by definition — about to be gone. Those orphan backups re-subscribe
    // toward the topic every tick; under load their SUBs strand into duplicate
    // sub-terminal roots, every duplicate replicates its cache to ITS cohort,
    // and the soak collapsed the backbone twice on exactly this loop (roles
    // >2000 → ingest storms → heartbeat evictions → mesh death). And because
    // the ack window is a race against load, "unacked" usually meant "acked
    // late" — the spray fired for topics whose heir already held the history.
    //
    // The fallback is now a single extra HANDOFF to the runner-up candidate:
    // the recipient adopts through the normal heir path (proper holder, purges
    // our beacon, never defers back to us) and the worst case plants TWO
    // holders that reconcile via union-ingest — the 4.22.1 footprint plus one
    // alternative, instead of an unbounded backup cascade. Heirless AND
