// window with no upstream pin, if we are the closest node among our REACHABLE
// neighbours we claim root locally — preferring a reachable root over a

// future since:'all' joiners. The root proactively replicates its full cache to its
// REPLICAS nearest reachable neighbours (the natural successors); on churn the

// couldn't see each other): a backup renews its subscribe every tick, so on root
// churn the SAME probe-protected machinery every subscriber/host uses — _rootHint_'s
// iterative lookup() → single globally-closest terminus — elects exactly ONE new root
// (the closest self-roots, the rest re-home under it), gap-free from the warm cache.

// The NEUROMORPHIC layer has had all three of these for a long time: a declared

// (NeuronNode.addIncomingSynapse just returns), and — under a cap — a stratified
// breadth-before-depth fill so a capped node spreads coverage instead of

// (utils/geo.js buildXorRoutingTable). The AXONIC layer had none of them: roles
// accrued without limit, a node could never say no, and a joining node was

// 325/431/523/720 roles on 961 MB boxes, five of nine locked out of the bridge.
//
// MAX_ROLES is the axonic MAX_SYNAPTOME. It is a SELF-DECLARED, SELF-LIMITING

// MAX_ROLES (above) counts roles. A count is the wrong instrument: 96 idle
// roles is nothing, 96 hot ones may be fatal, and the same count means
// different things on different hardware. What matters is whether a node can
// SERVICE what it holds inside the deadlines the protocol already imposes.
//
// Two deadlines already exist and are the honest denominators:
//
//   DROP_MS (180s) — a role/subscriber unserviced this long is treated as DEAD
//     by its cohort. So (age of my least-recently-serviced role) / DROP_MS is
//     literally "fraction of the way to silently rotting a role". At 1.0 a role
//     HAS rotted and nobody was told.
//
//   HELLO_DEADLINE_MS (5s) — the bridge closes a client that fails to complete
//     its hello in this window (the misleadingly-named state=upgrade-required).
//     Event-loop lag / HELLO_DEADLINE_MS is "fraction of the way to being
//     kicked off the network". This is the #332 spiral, made observable.
//
// Both are OBSERVED (wall-clock deltas over real state), not derived from the
// role count. That distinction is the whole point: ceil(roles/BUDGET)*tick is
// a linear function of the count — MAX_ROLES in different units — and would
// have dressed arithmetic up as telemetry.
export const HELLO_DEADLINE_MS = 5_000;   // bridge client-hello budget (mirror of the bridge's own)

// ── The tick-lag observation WINDOW (v4.49.0) ──────────────────────────────
// 4.47.0 recorded tick lag as an ALL-TIME high-water mark, which made
// helloPressure a ratchet: it could rise and could never fall. One 60s browser
// tab suspension — what every phone does on screen lock — put helloPressure at
// 11.0 (18x the 0.6 threshold) and left it there. Measured: still saturated
// after 2,050 healthy ticks (~2.8h). A saturated node refuses HANDOFF, so every
// backgrounded browser peer silently stopped being somewhere a departing node's
// last copy of a topic's history could land.
//
// The replacement is a rolling maximum over the last N ticks. A WINDOW, not a
// decay constant, deliberately: a decay factor has no natural unit here (why
// 0.95 and not 0.9?) and its recovery time is an emergent property you have to
// derive. A tick count states the recovery bound directly — "a stall stops
// counting against you N ticks after it stops happening" — which is the
// property the fence asserts and the property an operator needs to reason about.
//
// 12 ticks x the 5s refresh interval = ~60s of wall clock. (The window is in
// TICKS, so its wall-clock length follows refreshIntervalMs; every consumer in
// the fleet uses the 5s default — verified, no overrides in kernel, relay or
// bridge.) Long enough that a genuinely struggling node stays
// saturated across its bad patch; short enough that a recovered one is trusted
// again within a minute. The window only advances when a tick RUNS: a frozen
// node writes no samples and keeps its old reading, which is correct — we have
// no evidence of health from a node that isn't running.
export const TICK_LAG_WINDOW = 12;        // ticks retained for the rolling lag maximum

// What the refresh tick OWES each role, where that debt is discharged, and by
// when. Normative and machine-readable so it can be fenced the way SYNC_POLICIES
// is — a rule that is not a test drifts.
//
// WHY THIS TABLE EXISTS. Before D0, capacity was measured from a single
// `lastServicedAt` stamped on EVERY role at the TOP of refreshTick, before any
// work. The stamp therefore meant "a tick began while this role existed", not
// "this role's obligation was discharged", and servicePressure was measured
// against one denominator (DROP_MS) for every nature. Three consequences, all
// measured (test/d0_probe.mjs, commit 89c0798):
//   1. DOMINATED — reaching SATURATION_PRESSURE needed a 108s tick gap while
//      helloPressure needed 8s, so servicePressure could never be the deciding
//      signal in the only scenario it could detect.
//   2. FALSE NEGATIVE under the exact cause its own docstring named. 640 roles /
//      40 ticks: worst un-refreshed full push 95_000ms against its own 60_000ms
//      deadline, while servicePressure read 0, overdue read 0, saturated() was
//      false and admitPushedRole() still returned true.
//   3. COVERAGE — mySubscriptions was outside the walk entirely, so the node's
//      own app subscriptions were unmeasurable rather than mismeasured.
//
// THE FIX IS THE COMPLETION POINT, NOT THE FIELD. Each obligation is stamped
// where the work actually finishes. Two of these were already in the right place
// and simply were not being read: `sync.lastFullAt` is written inside the
// `if (full)` branch of _replicateRole, AFTER the pushes.
//
// DEADLINES ARE PER-OBLIGATION, and that is the second half of the fix. One
// DROP_MS denominator made 1.0 mean "failed" for renewal and something arbitrary
// for everything else. Now age/deadline == 1.0 means THIS obligation has failed,
// for every row, so the max across rows is comparable.
//
// ROOT carries replication only, deliberately. Beacons (BEACON_MS) and root
// self-verify are both throttled/batched, and a missed one costs convergence
// LATENCY; a missed replication costs DURABILITY. Measuring latency work as debt
// would re-introduce the false-positive risk this table exists to remove. That is
// a judgement, not a measurement — flagged as such to the council 2026-07-30.

// ── Empty-self-root cohort pull (v4.24.0 — the alert-bot read-miss fix) ──────
// A cold subscriber whose SUB terminates at itself becomes the topic's root with
// an EMPTY cache while a live holder (ex-root / backup / host) still has the
// history — and nothing tells the holder about the new closer root, so the
// state is STICKY (field: 82% of misses, unrecovered at 600s). The new root
// therefore PULLS: probe the K-closest cohort + the nodes on its own iterative
// lookup path (the runner-up closest is usually the prior root) with a
// PULLUP(sinceHw:0); any holder replays via the existing REPLAYUP → verified
// union-ingest. Delayed so a pub-terminal root (whose own publish fills the
// cache immediately) never probes; bounded tries so a genuinely-fresh topic
// quenches after finding nobody.
export const EMPTY_ROOT_PROBE_DELAY_MS    = 800;    // wait before first probe (skip if cache filled)
export const EMPTY_ROOT_PROBE_MAX         = 3;      // total probes per role while empty

// ── Leave-handoff confirmation (v4.24.0) ─────────────────────────────────────
// The graceful-leave HANDOFF was fire-and-forget: a failed heir delivery
// silently transferred nothing (diagnosis: gone=40/40 with leaveMs≈11ms — a
// CONFIRMATION failure, not a window failure). The leaver now waits briefly for
// HANDOFFACK, retries once, and finally sprays the cache to the K-closest
// cohort as REPLICATE (idempotent; backups store it, roots union-ingest it).

// HANDOFF_ACK_MS while heir-side ingest is O(topics received) — a mass leaver's
// few heirs absorb dozens of simultaneous cache ingests (time-sliced), so acks
// arrive in O(K) and "unacked" overwhelmingly meant ACKED LATE; every late
// topic fell through to a single unconfirmed Phase C fallback (68/68 warns on
// a ~68-root prod leaver). The window now scales with the round's batch size.
export const HANDOFF_ACK_PER_TOPIC_MS = 25;    // per-unacked-topic margin added to the round window
export const HANDOFF_ACK_MAX_MS       = 5000;  // per-round window cap (leave()'s outer bound already scales with role count)
