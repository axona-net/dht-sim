// =====================================================================
// rootClaim.js — the root-claim state machine (refactor Phase 1).
//
// EVERY flip of `role.isRoot` in the kernel goes through this module: one
// transition function (`_set`), one decision table of guards, one structured
// `root-transition` log line per flip. Before this existed, root-ness was
// decided at ~8 independent sites in AxonaManager and every incident added a
// guard at another site (the patch-interaction bug class —
// axona-docs/architecture/Kernel-Refactor-Analysis-v0.1.md §2A). The rules
// themselves are unchanged; they now live in one place.
//
// The machine holds NO state of its own. Role objects stay in
// manager.axonRoles; beacons/upstream/hints stay on the manager (they move in
// Phase 2). What lives here is the AUTHORITY: who may claim, when a claim
// defers, and the enforced invariants (INVARIANTS.md):
//   I-1  a topic has exactly one root; wrong claims converge without flapping
//   I-2  never defer to a farther node, a ghost, or the node handing off
//
// Transitions (why-codes appear in the root-transition log):
//   become(t, why)            — create the role AS root (routing-terminal fallback)
//   promote(role, p, meta)    — terminal promotion of an existing non-root role
//   demote(t, toHex, why)     — yield the claim to a strictly-closer live root,
//                               pin upstream to it, and re-subscribe under it
//   claimReachable(t)         — reachable-root fallback (unconfirmed deferral
//                               window expired; self is closest REACHABLE)
//   adoptChild(t, parentHex)  — ADOPT: become a non-root child relay
//   handoffArrived(t, leaver) — departing root handed us its history: purge the
//                               leaver's ghost beacon, never defer back to it

// orthogonal HOLDER flag (hosted / app-subscribed retention). The natures are
// DERIVED from the ground facts (isRoot, backupOf), never stored separately:
// a stored copy would drift, and drift here is the #333 bug class (a BACKUP
// whose principal was dead — a state nobody had modeled — self-perpetuated
// into the backbone collapse). Each nature carries obligations and a named
// eviction path; the table is normative in Axona-Architecture §VIII and
// enforced by smoke_role_natures.mjs.
//
//   ROOT    stamps, beacons, verifies, replicates, serves    → demote / idle sweep
//   BACKUP  holds warm copy; subscribes as election standby  → principal gone + re-homed + BACKUP_EVICT_MS
//   CHILD   renews upstream, re-fans down once               → subscriber loss + idle sweep
//   +HOLDER renews; advertises hw                            → unhost / unsub / TTL
