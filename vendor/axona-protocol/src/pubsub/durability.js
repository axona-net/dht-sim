// durability.js — the DURABILITY state machine, deliberately separate from the
// DELIVERY one.
//
// TWO MACHINES, NOT TWO BOOLEANS. Aster's specification, council 2026-08-01:
//
//   Local delivery : pending → delivered | cancelled
//     I-9 self-delivery satisfies ONLY this. Once delivered it stops payload
//     redelivery, and a KILL must CANCEL it before a retry can carry the body to
//     a late subscriber. That machine is `_pendingPub` in AxonaManager; the
//     retry pump reads it, and the kill already cancels it.
//
//   Durability     : pending → verified | expired | cancelled
//     Only a cohort CONSUMED verdict reaches `verified`. leave() drains on THIS.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE FILE. The defect this replaces was one flag carrying two facts:
// _deliverToApp called _confirmPending, so a publisher subscribed to its own
// topic — the only way to verify a publish, since there is deliberately no
// publish-ack — discharged DURABILITY by observing DELIVERY. The v4.58.0
// fail-closed gate was present, correct, counted, and bypassed. Two fields on
// one object would have re-merged within a month; a module with its own
// vocabulary is harder to conflate by accident. Nothing here knows what an app
// delivery is, and there is deliberately no function that a delivery path could
// call to reach `verified`.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED, AND BOUNDED. Silence never advances a message. Only an explicit
// cohort verdict does. `expired` is a real terminal state — a message that ran
// out of attempts is UNDURABLE and says so, rather than silently confirming
// (v4.57.0's mistake) or retrying forever (the mistake my first fix made, which
// re-delivered a killed body). The ledger is capped and prunes terminal entries
// oldest-first, because a diagnostic that outgrows what it describes stops being
// a diagnostic — the same lesson as role.attempted.

export const DURABILITY_MAX      = 4096;   // node-wide ledger budget; terminal entries evict first
export const DURABILITY_ATTEMPTS = 6;      // replication attempts before `expired`

    if (verified > 0) { e.state = 'verified'; e.at = this._now(); return e.state; }
    e.attempts++;
    // attempted === 0 means there was no cohort to try — a singleton root. That
    // is terminal and it is NOT durable: the node holds the only copy. Saying
    // `expired` here is the honest answer and lets leave() stop waiting for an
    // acknowledgement that can never arrive.
    if (attempted === 0 || e.attempts >= this._maxAttempts) {
      e.state = 'expired'; e.at = this._now();
    }
    return e.state;
  }

  // TOPIC-LEVEL transition, driven by the PERIODIC replication. This is the leg
  // that was missing: record() was called once at ingress and nowhere else, so
  // an entry that started verified:0 stayed pending forever, `expired` was
  // unreachable, and the attempt budget below was decoration. Aster caught that
  // the module documented a lifecycle it did not run (council 2026-08-01).
  //
  // TOPIC-LEVEL IS THE RIGHT GRANULARITY *ONLY FOR A FULL SNAPSHOT*. My v4.58.1
  // justification said "_syncPush sends the role's whole snapshot, so one
  // verified cohort push covers every message this root holds" — true of a full
  // push, and I wrote it unconditionally. It is false for the keepalive, and
  // Aster found both ends of that:
  //
  //   · dispatched:false — a deferral (`deferred-no-budget`) sends NOTHING and
  //     reports attempted:0, which record() reads as "no cohort exists" and
  //     retires to EXPIRED. A message whose snapshot never reached the wire was
  //     being declared permanently undurable because the tick was busy.
  //   · snapshot:false — an empty keepalive still resolves consumed and still
  //     counts verified>0, so it marked every pending message on the topic
  //     durable while carrying none of them. Reachable in ordinary operation:
  //     a new message whose eager full push fails, on a topic with a previously
  //     credited replica, meets a keepalive on the very next tick.
  //
  // So this is FAIL-CLOSED ON THE EVIDENCE FLAGS, and deliberately at the ledger
  // rather than the caller: _replicateRoots is not the only thing that could
  // ever call this, and a rule enforced at one call site is a rule that lasts
  // until the second call site. Anything that is not a dispatched full snapshot
  // is not evidence about a message, in EITHER direction — it must not verify,
  // and it must not burn an attempt. Silence still never advances anything.
  // THE ONE CLASSIFIER. Every replication outcome is exactly one of four kinds,
  // and both call sites — the periodic sweep and the eager ingress — go through
  // it. Aster's v4.58.2 finding was that my first attempt had THREE kinds and
  // needed four: I folded "no cohort exists" into the same no-op as "the tick
  // was busy", so a singleton root's message stayed pending forever instead of
  // reaching the honest undurable terminal it had before.
  //
  //   'no-cohort'   nobody to send to. TERMINAL and undurable — no future tick
  //                 can produce evidence, and this node holds the only copy.
  //   'no-dispatch' nothing was sent THIS TIME (budget deferral, or a caller
  //                 that could not run). Retryable. No state change, no attempt.
  //   'no-snapshot' an empty keepalive went out. Proves a peer is reachable,
  //                 proves nothing about a body it did not carry. Same no-op.
  //   'evidence'    a dispatched FULL snapshot. The only kind that may move a
  //                 message in either direction.
  //
  // STRICT === true, deliberately (Aster again): a missing flag is not a true
  // one. Defaulting the other way is inference, which is the exact habit this
  // module exists to break — and I had written `!== false` at the eager site one
  // commit after writing "capability is DECLARED, never inferred".

// =====================================================================
// RoleScopedDurability — node-wide FACADE over per-Role durability ledgers.
//
// David's invariant (council-unanimous, GH #26): a node's topics are TOTALLY
// independent, so the durability obligation is per-topic state and lives ON the
// Role (role.durability), never in one manager-global msgId table. There, two
// topics sharing a content-derived msgId (msgId = sha256({publisher,message}),
// topic excluded) collided: the second topic's open() no-op'd and its verdict
// polluted the first's obligation. msgId is unique WITHIN a role, so per-role
// keying is collision-free by construction — the structural fix, not a composite
// key masking one node-wide table.
//
// This facade holds NO obligation state. It routes every MUTATION to the owning
// Role's ledger (taken as a Role, never a bare msgId — constraint 1), enforces
// the node-wide budget at admission with role-local terminal reclaim under
// pressure (constraint 4), and AGGREGATES the read-only views observationally
// (constraint 2). Durability never rides HANDOFF (constraint 3) — it is
// node-local bookkeeping the leaver drains and the heir re-opens for new stamps.
