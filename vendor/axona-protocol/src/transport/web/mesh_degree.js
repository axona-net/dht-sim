// mesh_degree.js — pure selection for a bounded WebRTC mesh degree.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The mesh manager's own header says it maintains a channel
// "to every other peer in the mesh", and that is literally true: onPeerList
// initiates to every unknown peer and onPeerJoined accepts every arrival, with
// no bound anywhere. For a browser on a small mesh that is correct. For a
// BRIDGE it reproduces the problem the WebSocket degree cap was built to solve,
// one layer down and invisible to it: measured 2026-09-24, the east bridge held
// 17 inbound WebSockets against a cap of 15+2 while the west bridge held ONE
// inbound socket and 7 WebRTC peer connections, and its synaptome was exactly
// those 7. The cap governed one side of the node and not the other.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE IS. The same two-axis choice the bridge's WebSocket
// graduation makes (graduation_select.js), adapted to what the mesh layer can
// actually see:
//
//   1. KEYSPACE BALANCE (primary) — release from the most over-represented
//      nodeId region, and NEVER a region's last representative, so the set we
//      keep always spans the address space.
//   2. AGE (secondary) — within that region, release the LONGEST-HELD open
//      channel: it has had the most time for routing to find another path to
//      that peer, and the newest channel is the one most likely to have been
//      opened because something needed it.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated because the WebSocket side DOES see it. That path
// releases the BEST-MESHED peer, using the `meshBound` each client reports on
// its heartbeat — "the node whose departure the mesh best absorbs". No such
// report exists on the mesh path, so this is the same UPTIME FALLBACK the
// WebSocket side uses for peers that do not report. It is a weaker signal and
// the code should not pretend otherwise.
//
// THE OTHER THING IT CANNOT SEE is which peers carry obligations — a topic's
// root, an upstream, a cohort principal. The mesh layer holds channels, not
// roles. So the caller passes `protected`, and anything in it is never chosen.
// An empty `protected` set means the caller has told us nothing, NOT that
// nothing matters.
//
// Pure: no I/O, no timers, no manager state. The caller resolves each peer into
// a descriptor first, exactly as the bridge does for graduation_select.

/**

 * that certifies its own re-implementation is the exact failure Aster has named
 * repeatedly: an author's account of a mechanism is not evidence the mechanism
 * fires. Now there is one implementation and the fence drives it.
 *
 * THE CHAIN: meshId --nodeIdFor--> nodeId --obligedPeers--> duty?
 * The first link is the binding recorded at authentication. 4.95.0 skipped it,
 * read the bridge's own connection handle as a nodeId, and produced a cap that
 * could never select a candidate.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED at every step. No provider, a throwing provider, a non-Set
 * return, or an unresolvable binding all report PROTECTED. "Cannot say" is not
 * "no duty": keeping a channel costs a slot, dropping a duty costs delivery.
